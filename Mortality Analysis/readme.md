baseline_preprocessing.R cleans the baseline dataset and performs cox proportional hazards modelling with follow-up time as the x-axis.
cox_age_split.R performs cox modelling on the baseline, follow-up and stable medications follow-up datasets using participant age as the x-axis instead of follow-up time.
cox_follow_up_stable_meds.R performs cox modelling on the follow-up and stable medications dataset with follow-up time as the x-axis.
